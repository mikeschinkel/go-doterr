# update-doterr.sh
# Scan for all files named doterr.go under the current directory,
# and replace each with the canonical xmluisvr/doterr/doterr.go
# after rewriting the package line to be "package <dirname>".
#
# Usage:
#   ./update-doterr.sh           # do the updates (with backups)
#   DRY_RUN=1 ./update-doterr.sh # show what would change, don't write
#
# Notes:
# - Creates a .bak next to each modified file.
# - Skips the canonical file itself.
# - Handles paths with spaces.
# - Only the first "package doterr" line in the canonical file is replaced.
# - Requires bash, awk, mktemp, find, diff, mv.
